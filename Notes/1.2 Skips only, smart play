Game with only skips, opponent plays optimally

In this case, your opponent has the same strategy as you
Assumes 1 exploding kitten, only skips in deck and hand

Given x: deck size, y: your skip count, z: opponent skip count

 - 1 card left: Skip if you can. You win if you have enough skips to make your opponent draw the kitten
 - Draw: 1/x chance of dying, (x-1)/x chance of (1 - OPT(x-1, z, y+1)) --> Since that's your opponent's chance of winning
 - Skip: 1 - OPT(x, z, y-1) --> Since that's your opponent's chance of winning

Conclusions:
 - This is very similar to a noplay opponent, except that the threshold for enough skips to win is higher 
   (as your opponent also draws and plays skips)
 - As long as you don't have enough skips to skip out the rest of your turns, it doesn't matter how you play
