Conclusions:
 - Drawing is a lot better than skipping now (unless you can skip all your turns away) since you can just defuse in the unlikely case you draw a kitten
 - With 1 card left you have to have more defuses and skips than your opponent to be able to winRate
 - With odd # of cards going first is bad (since you have to win, not just tie if it gets to the last card standoff)
 - With even # of cards going first is good (first move advantage; you're likely to have 1 more card than opponent)
 - The win rate values converge towards 50% as the number of cards in the deck increase
