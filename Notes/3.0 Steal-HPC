Game with skips, attacks, defuses, and hairy potato cats. Opponent plays optimally.

Assumes 1 exploding kitten

WE WILL NOT BE TRYING TO READ THE OPPONENT!
We assume that the opponent does not try to read us by our moves

When making a choice, we will have to calculate probabilities of opponent's hands and cards in deck
to find the choice with the best expected value.

// There is definitely a mismatch somewhere

Select Data: (Experimental is 10,000 games)
With 4 skips, 2 defuses, 3 attacks, 4 HPCs:
 - Expected optimal winrate: 0.5033041753898129
With 4 skips, 2 defuses, 4 attacks, 4 HPCs:
 - Expected optimal winrate as P1: 0.4999938601873691
 - Experimental Winrate as P1 against self: 0.51795, 0.5134, 0.5138
With 4 skips, 2 defuses, 3 attacks, 6 HPCs:
 - Expected optimal winrate as P1: 0.5341430065635184
 - Experimental Winrate as P1 against self: 0.5073

Conclusions:
 - This algorithm is slow!
