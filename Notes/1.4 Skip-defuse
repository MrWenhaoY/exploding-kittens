Game with only skips, opponent plays optimally. 1 defuse per player and some in deck

Assumes 1 exploding kitten

WE WILL NOT BE TRYING TO READ THE OPPONENT!

When making a choice, we will have to calculate probabilities of opponent's hands and cards in deck
to find the choice with the best expected value.


Select Data: Expected winrates for first player starting with x skips and 2 defuses in deck:
0 0.28703703703703703
1 0.6315104166666667
2 0.33697942386831276
3 0.6174965920781893 | 0.61910 win (experimental against self)
4 0.3621466981907401 | 0.36192 win (experimental against self) | 0.48346 win (ex. vs dumbBot) | 0.73831 win (as 2nd player against DumbBot) 0.63983 (as 2nd player against DP_13)
5 0.6080744381212582 | 0.60917 win (experimental against self)
6 0.37758930432015575 | 0.37635 win (experimental against self)
7 0.6010294871469818

Conclusions:
 - With defuses in the deck, the difference between winRates for odd vs even converges slower, although they still converge
 - Drawing is a lot better than skipping now (unless you can skip all your turns away) since you can just defuse in the unlikely case you draw a kitten
 - With 1 card left you have to have more defuses and skips than your opponent to be able to winRate
 - With odd # of cards going first is bad (since you have to win, not just tie if it gets to the last card standoff)
 - With even # of cards going first is good (first move advantage; you're likely to have 1 more card than opponent)
 - We now have to calculate probabilities of opponent's hand based on draw and play histories. With low card counts, this is still feasible
   (even if not terribly efficient)
 - The algorithm is *noticably* slower: 100000 simulations of this bot takes a couple seconds ~15 whereas before it took almost no time (<0.5)
