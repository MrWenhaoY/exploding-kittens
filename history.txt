- Analyzed skip only game under optimal play
- Added Beard Cat, Cattermelon, Tacocat images
5/2/2024
- Analyzed skip only game under optimal play, but players start with 1 defuse each

- I have discovered the source of my pain. So apparently, when you log an object in the console,
  it shows the condensed version of the object's properties correctly (as in, the values at that time),
  but when you expand the object, it loads and caches the current properties of that object.
- Made deepCopy utility function to deal with that issue
- Fixed(?) issue with 14_DP algorithm
- Did some experimental analysis of the algorithm, got some puzzling results
- Turns out I had broken running a game with no-delay bots, and that caused problems with simulation. Fixed now.
- Fixed 14_DP analysis
